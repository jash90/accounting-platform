## Risk Management

### High-Priority Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| **Migration breaks existing auth** | Medium | High | Gradual rollout with feature flags, extensive testing, rollback plan |
| **Performance degradation** | Low | Medium | Load testing before each phase, caching strategy, query optimization |
| **Third-party integration failures** | Medium | Medium | Sandbox testing, fallback mechanisms, comprehensive error handling |
| **Team capacity constraints** | Medium | High | Clear prioritization, buffer time in schedule, external contractors if needed |
| **Security vulnerabilities discovered** | Low | Critical | Security reviews at each phase, penetration testing, bug bounty program |

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Gradual Rollout**
   - Use feature flags for all new features
   - A/B test with small percentage of users

2. **Rollback Plan**
   - Document rollback procedures for each feature
   - Test rollback in staging
   - Keep previous version deployable

3. **Communication**
   - Weekly stakeholder updates
